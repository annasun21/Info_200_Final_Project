Our dataset is on City of Seattle Staff Demographics. The data was created February 25, 2019 and is provided by the Seattle Department of Human Resources. It is updated on a monthly basis, with its most recent update being January 31, 2023.‚Äù)

An analysis of this data will be most helpful for Seattle HR employees. By analyzing employees in various departments by gender, race, and age,  hiring practices can be improved for fostering diversity and inclusion, an important aspect of hiring that companies should strive for. Here are some questions that will help guide our analysis: 

What is the percentage of White vs. Non-white employees per City of Seattle department?
How many male vs. female employees make up each City of Seattle department?
How do the wages of City of Seattle employees compare by race?
